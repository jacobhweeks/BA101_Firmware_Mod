# BA101_Firmware_Mod
Modification to the BA101 firmware for quick testing of batteries between 1 and 25 Ah.
This would allow testing of batteries outside of vehicle batteries that have the same or similar characteristics. i.e., UPS Batteries

TODO:
- Capture firmware file for reverse engineering using appropriate tools.
- This may only be possible by capturing the firmware from the device itself, since no firmware is available from the manufacturer.
- There are 3 sets of pins where it may be possible to capture the firmware that's on the device, so it can be modified and reuploaded to the device.
